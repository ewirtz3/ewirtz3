<h3 align="center">Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
<br/>

I am seeking a role as a Front End Developer, with hopes to eventually become a Product Manager. I have a BA from Creighton University, and a certificate in full stack web development from the University of Kansas. My strengths include effective communication, learning new things quickly, and a strong attention to detail.

I am a puzzle solver. Sometimes the puzzle at hand is scaling Operations for an e-commerce company, effectively executing a 100-person event, or writing a web application. Regardless of the situation, I love to look at every piece, putting them together to create something much bigger.
